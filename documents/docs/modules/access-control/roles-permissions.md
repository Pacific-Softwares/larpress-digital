# Roles & Permissions

Control access using role-based permissions.

## Concepts
- Role: a collection of permissions
- Permission: a single capability (e.g., `content.create`)

## Workflows
- Create roles that reflect job functions
- Grant permissions to roles, not users directly (except exceptions)
- Assign roles to users

## Tips
- Prefer least privilege
- Audit changes regularly in [Activity Logs](/modules/system/activity-logs)
