# API Tokens

Manage user-bound personal access tokens for API integrations.

## Features
- Assign tokens to any user via searchable owner picker
- Track token status (`active`, `inactive`, `revoked`) with color badges and filters
- Copy masked token values from the list view, with quick edit/view/delete actions

## Best practices
- Use least-privilege scopes
- Rotate tokens regularly
