# Content / Pages

Manage structured pages with type-aware layouts, media, and SEO metadata.

## Form highlights
- Auto-generate slugs from the title, with per-type uniqueness checks
- Choose content type, optional category, and active theme layout
- Capture ordering, popularity flag, external URL, thumbnail, and banner images
- Write summaries plus rich HTML (supporting `[[slug-of-html-block]]` shortcodes)
- Configure status, meta title/description/keywords, and add custom fields via repeater

## Table tools
- Searchable title, copyable slug, and type/status badges
- Status colors for draft/published/unpublished with quick filters
- Bulk delete and default sort by latest update

## Tips
- Keep layouts consistent with the selected content type
- Use additional data for lightweight key/value metadata
- Reference HTML blocks when you need reusable markup snippets
